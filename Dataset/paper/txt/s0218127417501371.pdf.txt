In the present paper, the phenomenon of noise-induced chaos in a piecewise linear system that
is excited by Gaussian white noise is investigated. Firstly, the global dynamical behaviors of
the deterministic piecewise linear system are investigated numerically in advance by using the
generalized cell-mapping digraph (GCMD) method. Then, based on these global properties,
the system that is excited by Gaussian white noise is introduced. Then, it is simpliﬁed by the
stochastic averaging method, through which, a four-dimensional averaged Itˆo system is ﬁnally
obtained. In order to reveal the phenomenon of noise-induced chaos quantitatively, MFPT (the
mean ﬁrst-passage time) is selected as the measure. The expression for MFPT is formulated
by using the singular perturbation method and then a rather simple representation is obtained
via the Laplace approximation, and within which, the concept of quasi-potential is introduced.
Furthermore, with the rays method, the MFPT under a certain set of parameters is estimated.
However, within the process of analysis, the authors had to face a diﬃcult problem concerning
the ill-conditioned matrix, which is the obstacle for the estimation of MFPT, which was then
solved by applying one more approximation. Finally, the result is compared with the numerical
one that is obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation.

Keywords: Piecewise linear system;

1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been considerable inter-
est in the research on the phenomena of noise-
induced dynamical behaviors in the ﬁeld of random
dynamical systems. Thus far, many of these phe-
nomena, such as, the so-called noise-induced chaos
[He & Habib, 2013; T´el et al., 2008; Lin & Young,
2008], intermittent switching behavior [Armbruster
et al., 2003; Stone & Armbruster, 1999], noise-
induced switching between cycles in the heteroclinic
networks [Armbruster et al., 2003; Stone & Arm-
bruster, 1999], synchronization [Zhou et al., 2003],

a lowering of the escape energy [Kraut & Feudel,
2003a; Hunt et al., 1996], transient chaos [T´el et al.,
2008; Kraut & Feudel, 2002], are observed and
found, that belong respectively to diﬀerent subjects,
such as ﬂuid mechanics [Aubry et al., 1988], neu-
rology [Dtchetgnia Djeundam et al., 2013], biology
[Billings & Schwartz, 2002], stochastic stability of
structures [Roy, 1996], population ecology [Ellner &
Turchin, 1995], chemistry [Naeh et al., 1990], laser
theory [Zhou et al., 2003], communications theory
[Hunt et al., 1996] and so on. It is noted that for

instability, even a small noise may result in these
kinds of phenomena. Thus far, most research meth-
ods emphasized on the numerical evaluation of the
maximal Lyapunov exponent [He & Habib, 2013;
Lin & Young, 2008; Aubry et al., 1988; Dtchetg-
nia Djeundam et al., 2013; Ellner & Turchin, 1995],
which is used to characterize the chaotic prop-
erties of signals, and the fractal dimensions [T´el
et al., 2008; Hunt et al., 1996], Stone and Holmes
investigated the behaviors of the heteroclinic net-
works under random perturbations [Aubry et al.,
1988], a noise-induced transition from a periodic
motion to a quasi-periodic or chaotic motion was
found numerically in a Rayleigh–Duﬃng system
[Hikihara et al., 2012] and furthermore via a
reduced-order Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov (FPK)
equation, a disappearance of a noise-induced energy
localization was found within a monostable Duﬀ-
ing system. In [Roy, 1997a; Roy & Nauman, 1995],
noise-induced chaos or
switching
behavior was found in multistable piecewise linear
systems, however under the assumption of elliptic
orbits and a two-dimensional Itˆo system, this phe-
nomenon cannot be analyzed analytically. Accord-
ing to the recent researches by the authors, for a
noise-excited piecewise linear system, a chaotic sad-
dle was found to exist among a wide range of param-
eters [Kong et al., 2016], which reﬂects the fact that
within the same range of parameters, noise-induced
chaos can exist.

intermittent

Recently, the concept of quasi-potential was
always used to characterize these complicated phe-
nomena, especially for the nonlinear system which
exhibits transient chaos or unattractive chaotic
attractors. The unattractive chaotic attractors were
found to be very common in a periodic window, and
the quasi-potential plateaus caused by chaotic sad-
dles were also observed [Kraut & Feudel, 2003b]
(see Figs. 4–6 in [Kraut & Feudel, 2003b]). The
quasi-potential was ﬁrst introduced by Freidlin and
Wentzell [2012], in order to investigate the behav-
ior of dynamical systems that were under random
perturbation. However, up till now, the method
of quasi-potential is mostly used in the numerical
simulations of the complicated nonlinear dynami-
cal systems which exhibit chaos or chaotic saddles,
and the reason is simply because the dynamical
structures of the nonlinear stochastic systems that
process these phenomena are complicated. Fur-
thermore, the quasi-potential was used by some
researchers to measure MFPT. In the study of

stability problem, stochastic stability is always
deﬁned as the stability of invariant density [Young,
1986], and an oscillator can be called stochasti-
cally unstable if the MFPT is ﬁnite [Klosek-Dygas
et al., 1988]. In this paper, the phenomenon of
noise-induced chaos obviously implies the stochas-
tic instability of a regular attractor, and MFPT
can characterize the enhancement of noise-induced
escape if the chaotic saddles exist [Hong et al.,
2010].

Based on the previous work of the authors
[Kong et al., 2016], a piecewise linear system is
investigated again in the present paper, for which
the phenomenon of noise-induced chaos is inves-
tigated furthermore. To measure the complicated
phenomenon quantitatively, a high-dimensional Itˆo
system is obtained and the relevant MFPT is esti-
mated via the singular perturbation method. In the
present analysis, the eﬀect of boundary layer is con-
sidered, which reﬂects the algebraic rate of change
of MFPT with respect to time, and as a result, the
more precise estimation of MFPT is then obtained.
Whereas, within the analysis process the authors
are challenged, wherein an ill-conditioned matrix
arises and hinders the estimation of the MFPT. To
solve the problem, by ignoring that term in the for-
mula of MFPT, which relates to the ill-conditioned
matrix, an approximate result is obtained. Despite
its complex forms, the approximate analytical result
reﬂects successfully the inﬂuence of chaotic saddles
on the exit behavior and matches the numerical
results well.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, in
the absence of noise excitation, the global dynami-
cal properties of the piecewise linear system driven
by only a harmonic excitation are illustrated by
using GCMD. In Sec. 3, for the system driven by
both a harmonic excitation and a Gaussian white
noise, an averaged four-dimensional Itˆo system
is obtained via the stochastic averaging method.
Based on the analysis upon the boundary layer
function and the rays method, the solution of the
FPK equation is obtained along each ray by solv-
ing a set of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs)
which are formulated in Sec. 4. In Sec. 5, on the
basis of Laplace approximation method and the
work of Z. Schuss and his co-workers, the expression
for the MFPT is formulated. As noted before, the
ill-conditioned matrix induced by the term within
the expression of MFPT arises, to solve the prob-
lem, one more approximation method is applied,

and ﬁnally, a comparison between the approximate
result and the numerical result simulated by Monte
Carlo method is given. The conclusions and some
discussions are summarized in Sec. 6.

2. Global Analysis
In this section, the global dynamical properties for a
deterministic piecewise linear system is investigated
in advance by using GCMD, prior to the inves-
tigation on the MFPT of the relevant stochastic
system, because of the complexity of the dynam-
ical behaviors. GCMD is known as a powerful
numerical method for inspecting and illustrating
the global and local properties of a dynamical sys-
tem [Kong et al., 2016; Hong, 2010; Hong et al.,
2010; Han et al., 2015; Han et al., 2014; Yue et al.,
2012; Hong & Xu, 2003; Hsu, 1995; Dellnitz et al.,
2001]. And some eﬃcient algorithms were devised
for obtaining invariant sets in high-dimensional sys-
tems [Dellnitz et al., 2001]. For the piecewise linear
system, its equation of motion is given by

where f(x) is a piecewise linear restoring force,
which is deﬁned as

and F (t) is the external excitation, i.e.

F (t) = f0 + f1cos(ωt) + ξ(t)

(3)

ξ(t) is the random process that has a zero mean
and the autocorrelation function (cid:3)ξ(t)ξ(t + τ)(cid:4) =
2Dδ(t), and D is assumed as a small parameter. In
mechanical systems, there are many buﬀers, bar-
riers and elastic stops to limit the amplitude of
vibrations, such as vibration dampers in a vehicle
and fenders. And the clearance or backlash between
gears cannot be avoided to model the vibration of
gear lapping system. All these systems are subjected
to piecewise linear restoring forces. Equation (1) is
a classical and generalized model with a clearance
type nonlinearity used to model many systems in
practical engineering projects, especially the vibra-
tion and impact systems within mechanical and
civil engineering. In this piecewise linear system,
many complicated dynamical behaviors have been
found.

In [Kong et al., 2016], the dynamics of a deter-
ministic piecewise linear system are investigated
numerically. Through the Monte Carlo simulation,
the noise-induced chaos is found twice if the fre-
quency of the external excitation ω is around 0.49
or belongs to the interval [0.7, 1.4], thus ω = 0.89
is chosen to be as the typical case to show this
phenomenon numerically. In the remainder of this
research, the values of some parameters are set as
ζ = 0.01, f0 = f1 = 0.25. For the system deﬁned in
Eq. (1) excited by a very small noise, Fig. 1 displays

where y-coordinate denotes
˙x. The comparison
between the signal in Fig. 1(a) before and after
noise is added, the fact that the chaotic saddle exists
in the deterministic system and the fact that the
phenomenon of noise-induced chaos exists in the
stochastic system are both veriﬁed. And the pro-
jection of this signal is displayed in Fig. 1(b).

Due to the complexity of the dynamical behav-
iors of the system deﬁned in Eq. (1), in this section
the GCMD method is applied to ﬁnd the reﬁned
structure of the phase portrait on the Poincar´e sec-
tion deﬁned in Eq. (4),
in the case of no noise
excitation (i.e. D = 0). The GCMD method is a
numerical method which is based on the general-
ized cell-mapping (GCM) method [Hsu, 1995, 1987]
and graph theory, and with the help of the the-
ory of digraph, this method extracts much more
information through numerical computation, such
as attractors, saddles and even chaotic saddles.
Although via this method, the accurate positions
of the ﬁxed points cannot be obtained, the areas
that they occupy are given, which are suﬃcient for
the qualitative analysis.

In Fig. 2, the green parts are two period-1
attractors, the black parts are the regular and
chaotic saddles, and the blue and red parts
are the stable and unstable manifolds of saddles
respectively. The remaining pictures in this paper

obtained from the GCMD method follow the same
convention. A cell space of 2000 × 2000 is used to
cover the phase diagram in Fig. 2, and there are
one period-1 stable solution with a large amplitude
(the green part in the upper right), one period-1 sta-
ble solution with a small amplitude (the green part
in the lower left), one period-1 saddle (the black
point located in the insertion of the blue and red
line in the left) and one big black part that has
a reﬁned structure which is a chaotic saddle. This
chaotic saddle is a set of saddles interconnected
by the manifold of each other [Kong et al., 2016;
Hong & Xu, 2003]. It is noted that if the resolu-
tion of this method is raised extremely, each of the
two period-1 stable solutions and the period-1 sad-
dle solution depicted in Fig. 2 should turn out to be
a point respectively on the phase portrait, however
the simulation process is uneconomical. Because the
purpose of the investigation here is to just show the
global properties of this system, not to determine
the exact positions of these solutions, the results
shown in Fig. 2 are enough here.

By comparing Fig. 1(b) and the chaotic sad-
dle in Fig. 2, it is observed that the phenomenon
of noise-induced chaos is a kind of exit problem
in which the system status exits from the basin
of the stable attractor to the chaotic saddle under
even a small noise excitation. That is how the
noise-induced chaos occurs. Furthermore, due to the
nonattracting property of the chaotic saddle, it is
impossible for the system to stay at the chaotic
saddle for a long time, instead it moves back to
the stable attractor intermittently. The intermit-
tent switching behavior occurs, as a result. So, the
noise-induced chaos is a kind of exit behavior for
dynamical systems wherein the attractors and the
chaotic saddles coexist. And we note that in gen-
eral, noise-induced chaos is not only a simple transi-
tion between chaotic saddles and regular attractors.
For example, Lin and Young studied noise-induced
chaos without intermittent switching behavior in a
two-dimensional system [Lin & Young, 2008].

In order

to characterize both the attrac-
tor and the chaotic saddle, a further analysis is
required with a smaller scope and a ﬁner resolution.
Figure 3(a) shows the reﬁned structure just around
the period-1 stable solution with a small amplitude.
In this small scale, it is easy to ﬁnd that there is
a period-3 saddle [three black parts connected to
each other in Fig. 3(a)] around the attractor, which
demonstrates that the period-3 saddle is the nearest

part of the chaotic saddle from period-1 attractor
and corresponds to the edge of the quasi-potential
plateau [Kraut & Feudel, 2003b; Hunt et al., 1996].
Choosing the right black point on the Poincar´e
section as the initial point, the trajectory of this
period-3 saddle is obtained numerically and plotted
in Fig. 3(b). Thus, we expect the analysis of the phe-
nomenon of noise-induced chaos can be replaced by
the analysis of the transition between the period-1
attractor and the period-3 saddle.

3. Simpliﬁcation of the System
Through the global analysis by GCMD method in
Sec. 2, one period-3 saddle is found just around the
period-1 attractor which corresponds to the edge of
quasi-potential plateau. Thus, the analysis on the
phenomenon of noise-induced chaos can be replaced
by the analysis on the exit behavior between this
period-3 saddle and the period-1 attractor. Since
both the white noise excitation and the damping
coeﬃcient of the system are small, the stochastic
averaging method, which is used widely for the
analysis of the exit problems [Roy, 1996, 1997b,
1994b, 1997a, 1994a, 1995; Rodrigues et al., 2010;
Chen & Zhu, 2010; Chen et al., 2009], can be applied
to simplify the system (1). It is noted that the
period-1 attractor and this period-3 saddle are both
structurally stable, thus it is reasonable to use an
approximation method, such as the stochastic aver-
aging method, to deal with this exit problem [Guck-
enheimer & Holmes, 1983], and the averaged system

as the substitution of the original piecewise linear
system will facilitate the analysis of the MFPT.

Via the comparison between the trajectory
depicted in Fig. 3(b) and an elliptic trajectory, it
is clear that the amplitude of this trajectory is
obviously period-3. Then, the power spectrum of
the motion around the period-3 saddle displayed
in Fig. 4 shows that the subharmonic frequencies
of orders 1/3 and 2/3 are present beside the main
oscillating frequency. Thus, by adding two period-3
harmonic components to the amplitude of the ellip-
tic trajectory, the approximate solution to Eq. (1)

seven independent variables contained in Eq. (5)

tion. Since the last term in Eq. (5) is the one with

sonable to ignore the last term to simplify the fol-

The van der Pol variables a, b, c, d, and e are
introduced to transform the periodic solutions in
the phase space (x, y) to the ﬁxed points in the van
der Pol phase space (a, b, c, d, e). Via the compari-
son between Figs. 6(b) and 3(b), it is easy to verify
that the expressions in Eq. (6) give well the approx-
imations of either the period-3 solution [comparing
Fig. 6(b) with Fig. 3(b)] under the condition that
r3(t) (cid:5)= 0 or d(t)e(t) (cid:5)= 0 or the period-1 solution if
r3(t) = 0 or d(t) = 0, e(t) = 0 [He & Habib, 2013;
Roy & Nauman, 1995]. With the assumption of the
approximate solution given in Eq. (6), it is reason-
able to consider all the variables of a, b, c, d, and e
as slow variables.

Eq. (9) and the application of the stochastic averag-
ing method lead to a set of averaged Itˆo stochastic

By substituting Eqs. (1), (3) and (7) into Eq. (11),
the algebraic equation is then obtained, i.e.

N0 = f0.

(12)
With Eqs. (10) and (12), a complete set of gov-
erning equations for (a, b, c, d, e) is gained, which,
under the assumption given in Eq. (6), is an Itˆo sys-
tem with a higher dimension than those of the Itˆo
system considered in [Roy, 1997a; Roy & Nauman,
1995]. Based upon this system, the phenomenon of
noise-induced chaos is predicted.

Firstly, the nonlinear deterministic version of
the averaged equations is considered, to which
cs, as, bs, ds, and es represent the steady-state solu-
tions. The equations are given by



(13)

−12ζesω − 4ω2ds + 9N1

= 0,
N0(as, bs, cs, ds, es) − f0 = 0.

12ω

It is noted that the hyperbolic ﬁxed points of
the averaged system correspond to the hyperbolic
periodic orbits in the original system, respectively
[Guckenheimer & Holmes, 1983]. Among all the
three solutions to Eq. (13), there is only one solu-
tion possessing the nonvanishing ds and es, which
are the functions of ω and are depicted in Fig. 6(a),
and under the condition that ω = 1.4, the two-
dimensional phase trajectory on (x, y) plane, which
corresponds to the period-3 saddle,
is shown in
Fig. 6(b).

4. Estimation of the Stationary
Probability Density Function

In Sec. 4, the stationary probability density function
of the four-dimensional Itˆo system that is deﬁned in
Eq. (10) is investigated in D, which is the domain
of interest and is completely inside the basin of

attraction of the stable equilibrium point mentioned
above [Fig. 3(a) shows that the basin of attraction
is very small]. The boundary of D is denoted by ∂D.
Suppose that x0 is a ﬁve-dimensional vector,

which is deﬁned by
x0 = [x1 x2 x3 x4 x5]T = [a b d e

c]T .
(14)
Since x5 is governed by the algebraic equation (12),
then x5 is a function of x1, x2, x3, x4. Thus the vec-
tor stochastic process of x = [x1 x2 x3 x4]T ,
which is deﬁned by Eq. (10), forms a vector diﬀu-
sion process and its stationary probability density
function p(x) satisﬁes the following FPK equation

Noise-Induced Chaos in a Piecewise Linear System

For the matrix A, aij = 0 for i (cid:5)= j, i, j = 1, . . . , 4,
and aii (cid:5)= 0 for i = 1, . . . , 4. This particular simpliﬁ-
cation is suitable for all the systems that are under
the external random excitations, and dramatically
reduces the complexity of the solution process for
the FPK equation (15).

For p(x), the normalization condition and

boundary condition are respectively given by

(cid:11)

p(x)dx = 1,

R5

p(x) = 0, x ∈ ∂D.

(17)

(18)

In order to ﬁnd the solution to the FPK equa-
tion (15) in the limit  → 0, the Wenzel–Kramers–
Brillouin (WKB) approximation is applied and
based on which, the approximation of the expres-
sion of the stationary probability density function
asymptotically is assumed as
− ψ(x)

(cid:10)
 + O()

p(x) = w(x) exp

q(x)

(19)

(cid:9)

wherein the function ψ(x) is the quasi-potential
function, w(x) is a prefactor function and q(x) is
the boundary layer function which satisﬁes the fol-

lowing condition(cid:12)

q(x) = 0, x ∈ ˜D,
q(x) = 1, x /∈ ˜D,

(20)

where ˜D denotes a thin boundary layer close to the
boundary ∂D. It is impossible to obtain the solu-
tion over the entire R4, however the solution over
the domain D is investigated instead.

By substituting Eq. (19) into Eq. (15), the fol-

lowing equation is obtained

4(cid:13)

q(x)L(z(x, )) − z(x, )L(ψ(x))



Based on Eq. (20), Eq. (21) is divided into two equa-
tions, i.e.

L[z(x, )] = 0, x /∈ ˜D,
4(cid:13)
−z(x, )L(q(x)) + 

i=1

aii∂iq(x)∂iz(x, ) = 0,
x ∈ ˜D,

(23)
which means that the ﬁrst term of Eq. (21) vanishes
outside the boundary layer and the other terms van-
ish inside the boundary layer.

The solution to the ﬁrst equation of Eq. (23)
is then investigated. By expanding the ﬁrst equa-
tion of Eq. (23) and identifying the terms of the
order −1 and 0, two independent partial diﬀeren-
tial equations of the ﬁrst order are obtained, the one
that governs ψ(x) is the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
(24)
and the other one that governs w(x) is the transport
equation

(25)
Based on the theory of partial diﬀerential equation
of the ﬁrst order, Eqs. (24) and (25) are both solv-
able by using the rays method [Ludwig, 1975]. The
rays of these two equations are governed by ordi-
nary diﬀerential equations, and along each ray ψ(x)
and w(x) are also governed by ordinary diﬀeren-
tial equations respectively. With appropriate initial
conditions, a family of rays is found to cover the
domain D, and then, approximate stationary proba-
bility density function is obtained in the domain D.
The equations governing the rays of Eq. (24) are
given below

where under the condition that aij = 0 for i (cid:5)=
j, i, j = 1, . . . , 4, the operator L is the substitu-
tion of the adjoint operator of the Fokker–Planck
operator L deﬁned in Eq. (15), i.e.

(27)

With Eqs. (26) and (27), a family of rays that covers
the whole domain of D is ﬁrst obtained, and then
the function of ψ(x) on each ray is determined.

Via the same method, the rays deﬁned by
Eq. (25) are obtained which are the same as those
that are given by Eq. (26). Along each of the rays,
w(x) is governed by

(cid:9)

(cid:10)

(28)

It is noted that Eq. (28) is diﬀerent from Eq. (27),
for Eq. (28) there are second partial derivatives of
ψ(x) involved, thus w(x) cannot be determined by
Eqs. (26) and (28).

To determine these second partial derivatives
of ψ(x), each equation in Eq. (26) needs to be dif-
ferentiated with respect to the three coordinates of
the four-dimensional space where the rays lie, i.e.
θ, ϕ, φ. Thus, along each ray, 24 ODEs are obtained,
i.e.

However, the second partial derivatives that arise in Eq. (28) cannot be solved directly from the above 24
ODEs, but from the following relationships based on the chain rule, i.e.

The situation now is that the 12 second partial
derivatives of ψ should be solved from the 16 lin-
ear algebraic equations, which is obviously over-
constrained, so the least square method is applied
here. Denote the inhomogeneous term and the coef-
ﬁcient matrix of the above linear equations by N
and C respectively, then the solution vector x which
consists of 12 second partial derivatives of ψ is eval-
uated by

X = (CTC)

−1CN.

(31)

Thus far, 34 ODEs are obtained from the com-
bination of Eqs. (26), (29) and (30), however the
corresponding initial conditions are missing, which,
according to characteristics theory of ﬁrst order par-
tial diﬀerential equation [Ludwig, 1975], will be dis-
cussed on a small hypersphere in R4 with radius α.

In brief, the solution to the ﬁrst equation of Eq. (23)
is obtained.

Next, the solution to the second equation in
Eq. (23), which is the governing equation of the
boundary layer function q(x), is then investigated.
Before the analysis, it is supposed that the bound-
ary ∂D is noncharacteristic, which means that the
following condition holds everywhere on the bound-
ary ∂D, i.e.

b · v < 0

(35)
where b is the drift vector of the system (10) and
v is the outer normal vector on the boundary ∂D.
This condition is satisﬁed readily by choosing the
domain D appropriately.

In order to analyze the boundary layer function
in the thin boundary layer ˜D, two new local coordi-
nates are introduced, (ρ, s) = (ρ, s1, s2, s3), where
ρ = ρ(x) characterizes the distance between the
point x and the boundary ∂D, and s = [s1, s2, s3]
are the local coordinates along the boundary. Since
every point x near ∂D corresponds to only one ray
deﬁned by Eq. (26), then only one point xb on the
boundary is found via each ray, which corresponds
to x. Thus, if the condition Eq. (35) is satisﬁed, ρ

is deﬁned by

ρ(x) = ψ(xb) − ψ(x).

(36)

And a stretched variable needs to be introduced, i.e.

µ =

ρ


.

(37)

Based on the new local coordinates, the new bound-
ary layer function is then given by

Q(µ, s) = q(x).

(38)

With the new boundary layer function and new
local variables, via a simple computation and iden-
tifying the terms of the order −1, a new boundary
layer equation governing Q(µ, s) is obtained, i.e.

L(ψ(x))∂µQ(µ, s)

of which the simple form can then be obtained,
on the basis of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (24),

i.e.

µµQ(µ, s) + ∂µQ(µ, s) = 0.
∂2

(40)
Combined with the boundary condition given in
Eq. (20), the solution is ﬁnally given by

Q(µ, s) = 1 − exp(−µ),

(41)
which is the ﬁrst-order approximation of the bound-
ary layer function.

With the boundary layer function deﬁned in
Eq. (41), the 34 ODEs given by Eqs. (26) to (29)
combined with their initial conditions given by
Eqs. (32) to (34) and the 16 linear equations deﬁned
in Eq. (30), the stationary probability density func-
tion deﬁned in Eq. (19) are obtained along each
ray in the domain D. Although this method leads
to a set of 34 ODEs which is a little complicated,
through it, the stationary probability density func-
tion for a high-dimensional Itˆo system is obtained,
which is the preparation for the estimation of the
MFPT.

5. Estimation of the MFPT
In Sec. 5 the exit problem of the noise-driven piece-
wise linear system that exhibits transient chaos
is investigated. Based on the singular perturbed
method, some results of MFPT and the distribu-
tion of exit points were given by Z. Schuss and his
co-workers [Naeh et al., 1990; Bobrovsky & Schuss,
1982], and the quasi-potential plateaus were found
in the systems that exhibit transient chaos [Kraut &
Feudel, 2003b]. In this work, based on the concept
of the quasi-potential plateaus, the phenomenon of
noise-induced chaos which is found in Sec. 2 is mea-
sured by MFPT. The simpliﬁed system with respect
to the period-3 saddle and the period-1 attrac-
tor has been established in Sec. 3. Then, with the
preparation that has been completed in Sec. 4, the
phenomenon of noise-induced chaos can be stud-
ied through analyzing the exit problem between the
period-1 attractor and the period-3 saddle in the
simpliﬁed system given by Eqs. (10) and (12).

In the following context, the derivation of
MFPT is just sketched at ﬁrst for the complete-
ness of this paper. In addition, since the model here
is about a system with much higher dimensions and
more complicated dynamical structures, the results
obtained by Z. Schuss and his co-workers are not
concise enough to deal with the problem directly
here, thus some approximation method is needed
to simplify the formula.

T0 =

Suppose that τ(x) is the exit time of the tra-
jectory which starts at the point x ∈ D and reaches
the boundary ∂D for the ﬁrst time. The Pontryagin
equation which τ(x) needs to satisfy is given as


Lτ(x) = −1, x ∈ D,
x ∈ ∂D,

τ(x) = 0,

(42)

where D is the domain within a four-dimensional
space, then ∂D is a three-dimensional hypersurface.
The solution to Eq. (42) is assumed as

τ(x) = T0τq(x),

(43)

where τq(x) is the boundary layer function and T0
is a constant, which, according to the second inter-
pretation in [Naeh et al., 1990], is formulated by

D

and v is the outer normal vector of the boundary

Before the calculation for Eq. (44), the domain
D and its boundary ∂D are needed to be deﬁned
speciﬁcally [Roy, 1997b; Roy & Nauman, 1995; Roy,
1994b, 1997a, 1995], i.e.

By substituting Eqs. (19), (45), (47) and (41)

However, due to the high-dimensional integral in
Eq. (48), this result is hardly available for a direct
calculation, then the Laplace approximation and
the condition given in Eq. (20) are applied to reduce
the complexity of the calculation, which leads to

where the matrix H is the Hessian matrix of ψ(x)
and xb is the point where the ray and the bound-
ary intersect. In comparison with Eq. (48), Eq. (49)
is simpler, and furthermore, for the estimation of
MFPT, there is no need to calculate a family of

rays that cover the domain D, just a calculation for
one ray which connects the initial point x0 that is
given in Eq. (32) and the point of xb is enough.

With Eq. (49), the MFPT under a set of param-
eters mentioned above is estimated and compares
with the numerical result simulated by the Monte
Carlo method. However during the analysis pro-
cess, the authors have to face a new problem of
which the matrix CTC that is deﬁned in Eq. (31)
is ill-conditioned and directly leads to its inaccu-
rate inverse matrix. The condition number is used
to characterize how ill-conditioned the matrix CTC
is. Figure 7(a) shows the variation of the condition
number of the matrix CTC versus the coordinate s
along one ray.

In Fig. 7(a), the ill-conditioned degree is very
serious. For example, if s = 34.25, the condition
number of CTC is 2.1358 × 109. Under this condi-
tion, if there are ten linear equations, the coeﬃcient
matrix of full rank can be selected from the 16 lin-
ear equations in Eq. (30), there are 2304 choices in
which the maximum condition number of the coef-
ﬁcient matrix is 1.18 × 108, and the minimum one
is 4.41 × 104. There is no doubt that the problem
of ill-conditioned matrix may lead to the incorrect
solution or no solution of w(x) to Eq. (19). And
Fig. 7(b) shows how the ill-conditioned matrix inﬂu-
ences the prefactor function w(x) and the function
w(x) is O(1) before the matrix gets ill-conditioned.
It is noted that these numerical complexities are
caused by the nonsmoothness eﬀect of the piecewise
linear function and cannot be avoided by choosing

a much smaller step size in numerical process [Hu,
1995]. Detailed discussions about these numerical
complexities are beyond the scope of this paper,
and will be given in the further work. Here, we fol-
low the method used in [Roy, 1996] and [Ludwig,
1975]. Since w(x) is of the order O(1) before the
matrix gets ill-conditioned as shown in Fig. 7(b),
the term w(xb) in Eq. (49) is then ignored without
loss of much accuracy. The ﬁnal solution of MFPT
is obtained, i.e.

It is remarked that in Eq. (31) the matrix C is
involved in the calculation of the matrix H, so
it must be ensured that the matrix C is not ill-
conditioned during the calculation.

As discussed in Sec. 2, the case of ω = 0.89
is selected as the typical one for the estimation of
the MFPT. There are two solutions to Eq. (13), one
is the period-1 solution, which is under the condi-
tion that as = −4.6291, bs = −1.7403, cs = 0.2874,
ds = 2.9451e − 4, es = −5.0282e − 6, the other
is the period-3 solution, which is under the condi-
tion that as = −0.6931, bs = −0.0779, cs = 0.6308,
ds = 0.2529, es = 1.1417. These results demon-
strate that the approximation Eq. (6) gives appro-
priate expressions of both the subharmonic solution
(period-3) and the harmonic solution (period-1),
and the dynamical behaviors such as the subhar-
monic motions and the harmonic ones given by the
deterministic version of the averaged system match
the ones of the original system.

On the basis of the solutions obtained above
and the result given in Eq. (50), domain D is deﬁned
via Eq. (46), wherein ˆψ = 0.00069 is selected. And
the methods used above, like the averaging method
and WKB approximation, are valid in the case
 → 0, i.e. D → 0, while the Monte Carlo simu-
lations can be only applied with ﬁnite noise inten-
sity D. Thus D−1 values in Fig. 8 are chosen to
vary between 5000 and 18 000. When D is chosen in
this interval, D is very small and of order O(10−5),
and meanwhile the numerical simulations do not
cost too much time. Then the ﬁnal result of MFPT
is estimated and the curve is plotted in Fig. 8,

which matches the result given by the Monte Carlo
simulation. The simulation results are obtained by
averaging 10 000 samples at each data point. These
two curves are both displayed versus D−1 on the
semi-logarithmic plot to get a clear observation of
the almost linear relationship between the loga-
rithm of MFPT and D−1 according to Eq. (50).
As the noise intensity D becomes large,
i.e.
D−1 becomes small, the error between these two
results also becomes large as shown in the inset of
Fig. 8. This fact is caused by Eq. (50) which is
valid in the case D → 0. When the noise inten-
i.e. D−1 becomes large,
sity D becomes small,
one can claim the agreement between these two
results. These results demonstrate that the tran-
sitions between the attractor and the saddle in
simpliﬁed system Eq. (10) can be used to analyze
the noise-induced chaos, and also demonstrate that
Eq. (50) is useful to estimate the phenomenon of
noise-induced chaos and the inﬂuence of the chaotic
saddle in the exit problem quantitatively.

6. Conclusions and Discussions
The phenomenon of noise-induced chaos
in a
piecewise linear system that is subjected to both
Gaussian white noise and harmonic excitation is
investigated. This phenomenon depends on the exis-
tence of a chaotic saddle around a regular attrac-
tor. Noise drives the system to switch between the
chaotic saddle and the regular attractor intermit-
tently. So the onset and termination of this phe-
nomenon are partly determined by the deterministic
bifurcation which creates and destroys the chaotic

saddle. And we choose the concept of MFPT to
measure this phenomenon of noise-induced chaos
quantitatively. After the onset of the noise-induced
chaos, a tiny noise can induce large displacements
from the deterministic stable state and the MFPT
is expected to be ﬁnite. Compared to regular situa-
tions, such a tiny noise could be expected to induce
tiny displacements from the deterministic stable
state and the MFPT is expected to be inﬁnite.

For the relevant system in the absence of noise,
through the numerical GCMD method, a chaotic
saddle is ﬁrst found just around the attractor. It
is noted that for the system of structural instabil-
ity, even a very small noise excitation leads to a
transition between the chaotic attractor and a peri-
odic motion [Fig. 1(a)]. Based on an assumption
of the approximate expression about the trajectory
of the periodic motions, the piecewise linear sys-
tem is simpliﬁed to a four-dimensional Itˆo system
by using stochastic averaging method. Thus for the
noise-driven system, the investigation on the phe-
nomenon of noise-induced chaos in the original sys-
tem is replaced by the one on the phenomenon of
transition between a stable attractor and a saddle in
the simpliﬁed system. Then the formula of MFPT is
obtained by using the singular perturbation method
and the Laplace approximation. In this process, the
eﬀect of boundary layer is considered.

Within the analysis, a serious problem the
authors have to face is that an ill-conditioned
matrix arises and hinders the calculation of MFPT.
Since the condition number of this matrix is too
large to obtain the accurate inverse matrix, one
more approximation is applied to simplify the ﬁnal
form of MFPT. The comparison between the ﬁnal
result and the numerical simulation conﬁrms that
the approximation method is available to character-
ize the phenomenon of noise-induced chaos quanti-
tatively, and the transitions between the attractor
and the saddle in simpliﬁed system can be used to
analyze the noise-induced chaos.

Although Eq. (1) is a general piecewise linear
system, we have noticed that in other types of non-
linear systems, not all noise-induced chaos can be
approximated to transitions between an attractor
and a saddle. If this approximation fails, the ana-
lytical procedure cannot work. Besides this, when
the intensity of noise exceeds some level, noise-
induced chaos disappears in this piecewise linear
system. To characterize both the onset and termi-
nation of noise-induced chaos, more concepts and

Noise-Induced Chaos in a Piecewise Linear System

techniques of random dynamics should be involved,
like random attractors and the stochastic bifurca-
tion. To devise a more general method to study
the onset and termination of noise-induced chaos
phenomenon in more complicated nonlinear systems
with multiple stable periodic attractors will be the
future direction of our works.
