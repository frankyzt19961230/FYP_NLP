Telecommunication plays an important role in modern societies that rely heavily 
on a knowledge economy. Telecommunication systems enable the transfer and 
exchange  of  information  over  communication  channels  that  are  corrupted  by 
disturbances and noises in a cost-effective manner. The major objectives of this 
subject are for the students to establish a firm foundation for the understanding 
of telecommunication systems, and the relationship among various technical and 
socio-economic factors when such systems are designed and operated. 
Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to:

2.  Analyze, measure, and evaluate the performance of a telecommunication 
system against given criteria. 
3.  Design  typical  telecommunication  systems  that  consist  of  basic  and 
essential building blocks. 
 
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness 
4.  Communicate effectively. 
5.  Think critically and creatively. 
6.  Assimilate new technological development in related field.

examinations are given to students to assess 
their  competence  level  of  knowledge  and 
comprehension,  ability 
to  analyze  given 
information,  ability  to  apply  knowledge  and 
skills  in  new  situation,  ability  to  synthesize 
structure, and ability to evaluate given data to 
make  judgment.  The  criteria  (i.e.  what  to  be 
demonstrated)  and  level  (i.e.  the  extent)  of 
achievement  will  be  graded  according  to  six 
levels: Excellent (A+ and A), Good (B+ and B), 
Satisfactory  (C+  and  C),  Marginal  (D)  and 
Failure (F). These will  be  made known to the 
students  before  an  assignment/homework  is 
given.  Feedback  about  their  performance will 
be  given  promptly  to  students  to  help  them 
improvement their learning. 
Students are required to conduct experiments 
in  team  of  2  students  each  in  four  laboratory 
sessions. The emphasis is on assessing their 
ability to apply knowledge and skills learned in 
designing, synthesizing and evaluating, ability 
in working with other people, and ability to take 
data  and  relate  the  measurement  results  to 
theory. Expectation and grading criteria will be 
given as in the case of assignment/ homework.
