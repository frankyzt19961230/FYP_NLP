Tutorials where 
design problems are 
discussed, and are 
given to students for 
them to solve 
In  tutorials,  students  apply  what 
they  have  learnt  in  analyzing  the 
cases  and  solving  the  problems 
given by the tutor. They will analyze 
the given information, compare and 
contrast  different  scenarios  and 
propose solutions or alternatives. 
Laboratory sessions, 
where students will 
perform a mini-project 
by computer 
simulations and 
experimental 
verifications. They will 
have to write a report 
on their mini-projects.

comprehension  of  the  knowledge 
taught.  They  will  analyze  given 
information and apply knowledge in 
solving  problem.  For  some  design 
type of questions, they will have to 
synthesize  solutions  by  evaluating 
different alternatives.

Assignment/Homework  and  case  study  reports 
are given to students to assess their competence 
level of knowledge and comprehension, ability to 
analyze  given 
to  apply 
knowledge  and  skills  in  new  situation,  ability  to 
synthesize structure, and ability to evaluate given 
data to make judgment. The criteria (i.e.  what to 
be  demonstrated)  and  level  (i.e.  the  extent)  of 
achievement  will  be  graded  according  to  six 
levels: (A+ and A), Good (B+ and B), Satisfactory 
(C+ and C), Marginal (D) and Failure (F). These 
will  be  made  known  to  the  students  before  an 
assignment/homework  is  given.  Feedback  about 
their  performance  will  be  given  promptly  to 
students to help them improvement their learning. 
Students will be required to perform a mini-project 
and  submit  a  report.  The  emphasis 
is  on 
assessing  their  ability  to  use  VLSI  CAD  tools 
effectively  to  perform  VLSI  design.  Expectation 
and grading criteria will be given as in the case of 
assignment/homework. 
There  will  be  a  mid-semester  test  to  evaluate 
students’  achievement  of  all 
learning 
outcomes  and give feedback  to them for  prompt 
improvement. Expectation and grading criteria will 
be given as in the case of assignment/homework.
