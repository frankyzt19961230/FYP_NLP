Objectives 
 
This course aims at training students to master the basic principles, knowledge, 
and skills about network management and network security. They will learn how 
to apply these principles in various scenarios by using appropriate hardware and 
software tools to design solutions for network management and security problems, 
and to evaluating performance.

Methodology  
 
 
Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to: 
 
Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 
1.  Describe some common features about network management systems 
2.  Perform basic network management tasks with appropriate tools 
3.  Describe some network security services and functions 
4.  Analyze and evaluate some common security features of computer 
networks 
5.  Design simple network management and security systems 
 
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness 
6.  Communicate Effectively 
7.  Understand the creative process when designing a solution to a problem 
1.  Network Management 
Functional  areas  in  network  management,  network  management  station, 
agent, management information base (MIB), Simple Network Management 
Protocol (SNMP) 
 
2.  Network Security 
Security  services  and  mechanisms,  basic  cryptography,  authentication 
protocols, digital signature and public key infrastructure, firewall and virtual 
private network (VPN) 
Lectures: The subject matters will be delivered through lectures. Students will 
be engaged in the lectures through Q&A, discussions and specially designed 
classroom activities. 
 
Tutorials: During tutorials, students will work on/discuss some chosen topics in 
small group. This will help strengthen the knowledge taught in lectures. 
 
Laboratory: During laboratory exercises, students will perform hands-on tasks 
to practice what they have learned. They will evaluate performance of systems 
and design solutions to problems.

Explanation  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  assessment  methods  in 
assessing the intended learning outcomes: 
 
Assignment and homework will require students to apply what they have learnt 
to  solve  problems.  They  will  be  asked  to  evaluate  the  security  features  of  a 
system,  to  design  a  system  to  meet  network  management  and  security 
requirements. 
 
Laboratory  exercises:  Students  will  be  assessed  about  their  performance  on 
hands-on  tasks  such  as  setting  up  a  VPN,  capturing  and  analyzing  packets, 
setting up a network management system. 
 
Tests  will  require  the  students  to  solve  network  management  and  security 
problems within a specific time and without access to other materials. This is a 
good way to assess students’ mastery of knowledge and understanding. 
 
Examination: This is similar to tests but in a larger scale. It can assess students’ 
achievement of the learning outcomes in a wider spectrum.
