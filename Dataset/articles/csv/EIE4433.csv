Engineering  is  the  science  of  solve problems  by  applying scientific  principles 
and  technology  in  order  to  improve  human  life.  This  may  take  the  form  of 
invention, design, implementation, so on and so forth. It is important for students 
to  have  the  chance  to  design  and  implement  solutions  to  existing  problems 
while considering various constraints. They will also have the chance to apply 
the  knowledge  they  have  learned  throughout  the  curriculum.  The  Honours 
Project  (also  called  Final-Year  Project  or  FYP  in  short)  in  the  curriculum  is 
designed with the following objectives: 
1.  To provide the opportunity to the students so that they can apply what they 
have learnt in previous stages in a real-life engineering context. 
2.  To enable the students to acquire and practise project management skills 
and discipline while pursuing the Honours Project. 
3.  To  enable  the  student  to  apply  engineering  knowledge  in  analysis  of 
problems and synthesis of solution while considering various constraints. 
Intended Subject 
Learning Outcomes 
  
Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to: 
 
 
Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 
1.  Understand the background, the requirements, objectives, and deliverables 
Subject Synopsis/ 
Indicative Syllabus 
  
to be produced for the specific project. 
2.  Apply  knowledge  and  skills  relevant  to  electronic  and  information 
engineering to achieve the objectives of the project. 
3.  Learn to use new tools and facilities, and to gather new information, for the 
conduction of the project. 
 
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness  
4.  Work under the guidance of a supervisor while exercising self-discipline to 
manage the project. 
5.  Communicate  effectively  with 
related  parties 
(supervisor,  peers, 
vendors, ..etc.). 
6.  Work  with  others  (team  partners,  outsource  company,  technical  support 
staff, ...etc.) collaboratively. 
7.  Realize different constraints when designing solutions. 
Syllabus: 
 
The progression of the project will consist of the following stages.  
 
Project Specification 
In this stage, the student will work in conjunction with the project supervisor to 
draw up a concrete project plan specifying at least the following: 
 
1.  Background of the project 
2.  Aims and objectives 
3.  Deliverables 
4.  Methodology to be adopted 
5.  Schedule 
 
 
 
 
Project Execution 
After the specification is done, the project will be pursued so that the objectives 
are  to  be  met;  the  deliverables  are  to  be  produced  in  accordance  with  the 
schedule. The student and the project supervisor will meet constantly to discuss 
the progress. In particular the following should be demonstrated: 
 
1.  Adherence to the schedule 
2.  Achievement of objectives by the student’s work 
3. 
4. 
Initiatives of the students to work, design, and to solve problems 
Inquisitiveness of the student (e.g. to probe into different phenomena or to 
try different approaches) 
5.  Diligence of the students to spend sufficient effort on the project 
6.  Systematic  documentation  of  data,  design,  results,  …etc.  during  the 
process of working out the project 
 
Project Report 
 
After  the  project  is  finished,  it  is  important  that  the  student  is  competent  in 
disseminating  the  results  for  others  to  review.  Through  this  dissemination 
process,  project  achievements  can  be  communicated,  experience  can  be 
shared,  knowledge  and  skills  learnt  can  be  retained  and  transferred.  The 
following elements will be important as evidence of students’ achievement: 
 
1.  Project log book (documenting the work done over the year) 
2.  Project report (hardcopy and softcopy) 
3.  Presentation 
4.  Performance in a Question-and-Answer session 
5.    Demonstration
