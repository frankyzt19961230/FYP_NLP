Students will be most benefited from doing projects in order to have the chance 
to  practise  hands-on  application  of  the  knowledge  the  student  has  learned 
through the curriculum, while producing something useful or valuable.  On this 
ground,  the  Honours  Project  (also  called  Final-Year  Project  or  FYP  in  short) 
component in the curriculum is designed that meets the following objectives: 
 
1.  To provide the opportunity to the students to apply what they have learned 
in previous stages in a real-life technological problem 
2.  To enable  the  student  to  acquire  and practise  project  management  skills 
and discipline on pursuing the Honours Project 
3.  To  enable  the  student  to  apply  knowledge  in  internet  and  multimedia 
to  analyse  problems  and  synthesize  solutions  while 
technologies 
considering various practical constraints. 
Intended Subject 
Learning Outcomes 
  
Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to: 
 
Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 
1.  Understand the background, requirements, objectives, and deliverables to 
be produced for the specific project 
2.  Apply knowledge and skills relevant to internet and multimedia technologies 
to achieve the objectives of the project. 
3.  Learn to use new tools and facilities, and to gather new information, for the 
conduction of the project 
 
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness 
4.  Work under the guidance of a supervisor while exercising self-discipline to 
manage the project 
5.  Communicate  effectively  with related  parties  (supervisor,  peers,  vendors, 
etc.) 
6.  Work  collaboratively  with  others  (team-partners,  outsource  company, 
technical support staff, etc.) 
7.  Realize different constraints, and to make appropriate compromise, when 
creatively designing the solution to a technical problem. 
Syllabus: 
 
The progression of the project will consist of the following stages: 
 
Project Specification 
In this stage, the student will work in conjunction with the project supervisor to 
draw up a concrete project plan specifying at least the following: 
 
1.  Background of the project 
2.  Aims and objectives 
3.  Deliverables 
4.  Methodology to be adopted 
5.  Schedule 
 
Project Execution 
The project will be pursued so that the objectives are to be met; the deliverables

are  to  be  produced  in  accordance  with  the  schedule.    The  student  and  the 
project supervisor will meet constantly to discuss the progress.  In particular the 
following should be demonstrated: 
 
1.  Adherence to the schedule 
2.  Achievement of objectives by the student’s work 
3. 
4. 
Initiatives of the student to work, design, and to solve problems 
Inquisitiveness of the student (e.g. to probe into different phenomena or to 
try different approaches) 
5.  Diligence of the student to spend sufficient effort on the project 
6.  Systematic documentation of data, design, results, etc. during the process 
of working out the project 
 
Project Report 
It  is  important  that  the  student  is  competent  in  disseminating  the  results  for 
others  to  review.    Through  this  dissemination  process,  project  achievements 
can  be  communicated,  experience  can  be  shared,  and  knowledge  and  skills 
learned  can  be  retained  and  transferred.    The  following  elements  will  be 
important as evidence of achievement: 
 
1.  Project log book (documenting the work done over the year) 
2.  Project report (hardcopy and softcopy) 
3.  Presentation 
4.  Performance in a Question-and-Answer session 
5.  Demonstration
