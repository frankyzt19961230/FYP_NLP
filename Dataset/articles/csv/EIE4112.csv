Explanation  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  assessment  methods  in 
assessing the intended learning outcomes: 
Overall Assessment: 
 
0.40  End of Subject Examination + 0.60  Continuous Assessment 
The  continuous  assessment  consists  of  three  components:  homework 
assignments,  test,  and  case  study  report.    They  are  aimed  at  evaluating  the 
progress  of  students  study,  assisting  them  in  self-monitoring  of  fulfilling  the 
respective  subject  learning  outcomes,  and  enhancing  the  integration  of  the 
knowledge learnt. 
The examination is used to assess the knowledge acquired by the students for 
understanding and analyzing the problems critically and independently; as well 
as to determine the degree of achieving the subject learning outcomes.
