Teaching/Learning 
Methodology  
 
Lectures: The subject matters will be delivered through lectures. Students will 
be engaged in the  lectures through Q&A, discussions and specially designed 
classroom activities. 
 
Tutorials: During tutorials, students will work on/discuss some chosen topics in 
small group. This will help strengthen the knowledge taught in lectures. 
 
Laboratory and assignments: During laboratory exercises, students will perform 
hands-on  tasks  to  practice  what  they  have  learned.  They  will  evaluate  the 
vulnerability of systems and design solutions to problems. The assignments will 
help students to review the knowledge taught in class. 
While lectures and tutorials will help to achieve the professional outcomes, the 
open-ended questions in laboratory exercises and assignments will provide the 
chance to students to exercise their creativity in problem solving.
