Objectives 
To provide students with a broad view in both hardware and software aspects 
of  digital  systems  in  general  and  microprocessor  systems  in  particular,  and 
enable them to gain understanding and skills that will be used in later computer 
related courses.    Emphasis will be placed on topics including: 
 
1.  Common binary logic components found in a microcomputer system 
2.  Use and applications of programmable logic devices 
3.  Structure and organization of microprocessors
