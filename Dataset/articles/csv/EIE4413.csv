Remarks 
Fundamental  principles  and 
key 
concepts of the subject are delivered to 
students 
Supplementary to lectures, tutorials are 
conducted  with  smaller  class  size. 
Students will be able to clarify concepts 
and to have a deeper understanding of 
the  lecture  material;  problems  and 
application  examples  are  given  and 
discussed. 
Students will make use of the software 
tool  to  simulate  the  various  theories 
and visualize the results.

Tests and examination  End-of  chapter  type  problems  used  to  evaluate 
students’  ability  in  applying  concepts  and  skills 
learnt in the classroom, and their comprehension 
of subject materials. 
Students need to think critically in order to come 
with a good solution for the problem given. 
Assignment  
Students have to learn independently, to search, 
digest and analyze data.   
Laboratory sessions 
 
Each  student  is  required  to  produce  a  report  on 
the  laboratory  work  they  conduct.  Each  student 
also needs to make a demonstration on the open-
ended question set out in each laboratory work.
