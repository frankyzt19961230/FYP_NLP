Intended Subject 
 
Learning Outcomes 
 
focus on intrusion detection and penetration test 
2.  To  enable  the  students  to  master  the  knowledge  about  intrusion  detection 
and penetration test in the context of real-life applications 
3.  To  prepare  the  students  for  understanding,  evaluating  critically,  and 
assimilating new knowledge and emerging technology in network security 
Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to: 
Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 
1.  Understand  the  physical  location,  the  operational  characteristics  and  the 
various functions performed by the intrusion detection/prevention system 
2.  Describe how components in different layers inter-operate in the intrusion 
detection/prevention system 
3.  Understand  the  current  network  security  vulnerabilities  and  effective 
procedures of penetration test 
4.  Learn  new  techniques  and  to  align  new  security  technologies  to  existing 
network infrastructure 
 
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness 
5.  Present ideas and findings effectively 
6.  Learn independently 
Subject Synopsis/ 
Indicative Syllabus 
  
Syllabus: 
 
1.  Vulnerabilities and  Security Threats to Computer Networks 
Sources of vulnerabilities, types of attacks, attacks against various security 
objectives, countermeasures of attacks. 
 
2.  Penetration Test Methodologies and Procedures 
White-box  /  grey-box  testing,  security  surfaces  for  evaluation,  automated 
tools for vulnerability scan and penetration test. 
 
3. 
 
4. 
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Technologies 
Host-based  intrusion  detection  system  (IDS)  /  intrusion  prevention  system 
(IPS),  network-based  IDS/IPS.  Intrusion  detection  techniques,  misuse 
detection:  pattern  matching,  policy-based  and  state-based;  anomaly 
detection: statistical based, honeypots-based; hybrid detection.    
IDS and IPS Architecture 
Tiered architectures, single-tiered, multi-tiered, peer-to-peer. Sensor: sensor 
functions,  sensor  deployment  and  security.  Agents:  agent  functions,  agent 
deployment  and  security.  Alert  management:  alert  types,  alert  manager 
deployment  and  security.  Information  flow  in  IDS  and  IPS,  defending 
IDS/IPS.  
 
5.  Network Security Monitoring 
Network traffic collection and storage, detection mechanisms and indicators 
of compromise, packet analysis, friendly and threat intelligence. 
 
6.  Deployment of IDS/IPS 
Case study on commercial and open-source IDS.

Remark 
Mini Project 
 
Tests and 
examination 
Students  need  to  think  critically  and  creatively  in 
order  to  come  with  a  solution  for  a  practical 
problem. 
Mainly  objective  tests  conducted  to  measure  the 
students’  understanding  of 
theories  and 
concepts as well as their comprehension of subject 
materials;  
the 
End-of-chapter  type  problems  used  to  evaluate 
students’  ability  in  applying  concepts  and  skills 
learnt in the classroom. 
Laboratory sessions 
Each  student  is  required  to  produce  a  real-life 
demo  and/or  a  written  report  to  evaluate  his 
technical knowledge and communication skills.
