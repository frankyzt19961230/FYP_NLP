Remarks 

Fundamental principles and key concepts of the 
subject are delivered to students. 

These  are  supplementary  to  lectures  and  are 
conducted with smaller class sizes;  
students  will  be  able  to  clarify  concepts  and  to 
gain  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  lecture 
material;  
problems  and  application  examples  are  given 
and discussed. 

Laboratory 
sessions 

4, 5 

Students  will  make  use  of  software  to  simulate 
the various theories and visualize the results.

Laboratory sessions 

These can measure the students’ understanding 
of  the  theories  and  concepts  as  well  as  their 
comprehension of subject materials. 

End-of  chapter 
to 
evaluate the students’ ability in applying concepts 
and skills learnt in the classroom; 

type  problems  are  used 

students  need  to  think  critically  and  to  learn 
independently  in  order  to  come  up  with  an 
alternative solution to an existing problem. 

Students are required to conduct some laboratory 
works, and produce the written reports; 

The  accuracy  and  presentation  of  the  report  will 
be assessed; 

the emphasis is on assessing the students’ ability 
to apply knowledge and skills learned in lectures, 
and their ability to relate the taken data and results 
to the most relevant theory.
