Remarks 

fundamental  principles  and 
key 
concepts of the subject are delivered to 
students 

supplementary  to  lectures  and  are 
conducted with smaller class size;  
students will be able to clarify concepts 
and to have a deeper understanding of 
the lecture material;  
problems  and  application  examples 
are given and discussed 

students  will  make  use  of  network 
simulators to simulate various types of 
communication networks and evaluate 
their  performance,  or  students  will 
develop a simple multimedia streaming 
system 
by 
different 
together  using  some 
components 
existing tools.

comprehension of subject materials 

end-of  chapter  type  problems  used  to  evaluate 
students’  ability  in  applying  concepts  and  skills 
learnt in the classroom; 
students  need  to  think  critically  and  creatively  in 
order  to  come  with  an  alternate  solution  for  an 
existing problem 

each group of students are required to produce a 
written report; 
accuracy and the presentation of the report will be 
assessed.
