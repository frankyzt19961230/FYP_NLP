To provide students with a broad view in digital logic design and enable them to 
gain understanding and skills that will be used in later computer-related courses. 

Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to: 
 
 
Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 
1.  Understand 

the 

fundamentals  of  digital  systems  and  associated 

technologies. 

2.  Analyse and design simple systems related to digital logic. 
3.  Apply 

to  construct  digital  systems  with 
programmable logic devices and microprocessors, and appreciate the use 
of them. 

logic  design 

techniques 

4.  Appreciate the importance of creativity and critical thinking on finding “good” 

solutions or making “good” designs. 

 
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness 
5.  Think critically.

Assignments   

Enhance the understanding of the taught materials 
in the lectures. 

Tests and examination  End-of chapter type problems are used frequently 
to  evaluate  students’  ability  in  applying  concepts 
and skills learned in class. 
The students are also needed to think critically and 
creatively in the process of solving problems. 

Laboratory sessions 

Each student is required to do a demonstration and 
submit a lab report after the laboratory.
