Teaching/Learning 
Methodology  

 

Lectures: Fundamental principles and key concepts of the subject are delivered 
to students. 
 
Tutorials:  Students  will  be  able  to  clarify  concepts  and  to  have  a  deeper 
understanding of the lecture material; problems and application examples are 
given  and discussed. Students  will be given programming exercises and use 
database development tools to design database. 
 
Laboratory  Sessions:  Students  will  do  some  programming  exercises  to 
enhance their understanding on database design and development.

Explanation  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  assessment  methods  in 
assessing the intended learning outcomes: 

Short quizzes: These can measure the students’ understanding of the theories 
and concepts as well as their comprehension of subject materials. 

Test  &  Examination:  End-of-chapter-type  problems  are  used  to  evaluate  the 
students’ ability in applying concepts and skills learnt in the classroom; students 
need to think critically and to learn independently in order to come up with an 
appropriate design. 

Laboratory:  Each  student  is  required  to  produce  a  report;  the  accuracy  and 
presentation of the report will be assessed. 

Class contact (time-tabled): 

 

  Lecture/Tutorial 

  Laboratory/Practice Classes 

Other student study effort: 

  Lecture: preview/review of notes; 

homework/assignment; preparation for 
test/quizzes/examination 

  Tutorial/Laboratory/Practice Classes: preview of 

materials, revision and/or reports writing
