End-of-chapter type problems used to evaluate 
students’  ability  in  applying  concepts  and  skills 
learnt in the classroom; 

Laboratory sessions 

 

Each  student  is  required  to  answer  several 
questions related to each lab session in the lab 
sheet  and  hand  in  his/her  answers.  Students 
need to think critically and creatively in order to 
come  with  an  alternate  solution  for  an  existing 
problem.
