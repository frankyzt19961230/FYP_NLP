Remark 

tests 

true-false, 

(e.g.,  multiple-choice 
mainly  objective 
questions, 
items) 
conducted  to  measure  the  students’  ability  to 
remember 
their 
comprehension of subject materials 

figures  as  well  as 

and  matching 

facts  and 

end-of  chapter  type  problems  used  to  evaluate 
students’ ability in applying concepts and skills learnt 
in the classroom; 
students  need  to  think  critically  and  creatively  in 
order  to  come  with  an  alternate  solution  for  an 
existing problem 

Laboratory sessions  Each students is required to produce a written report; 
accuracy  and  the  presentation  of  the  report  will  be 
assessed; 
oral examination based on the laboratory exercises 
will be conducted for each student to evaluate his/her 
technical knowledge and communication skills
