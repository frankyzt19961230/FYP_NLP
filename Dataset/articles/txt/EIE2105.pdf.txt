Remarks 

Fundamental principles and key concepts 
of the subject are delivered to students. 

Supplementary  to  lectures  are  conducted 
with smaller class size. 
The  students  will  be  able 
concepts  and 
understanding of the lecture material. 
Some exercises and application examples 
are given for discussion.

to  have  a  better 

Through  working  assignment  and  end-of-
chapter  problems  in  text  books,  students 
will  develop  a  firm  understanding  and 
comprehension of the knowledge taught. 

Laboratory 
sessions 

1, 2, 3 

Students will make use of the software and 
hardware  tools  to  develop  simple  digital 
systems and perform simulations.

Remark 

End-of  chapter  type  problems  are  used  to  evaluate 
students’ ability in applying concepts and skills learned 
in  class.  Larger  individual  assignments  will  bet  set  in 
order  to  challenge  students  to  apply  the  course 
contents in a more realistic setting.  

 
Students are needed to think critically and creatively in 
order to come with an alternate solution for an existing 
problem. 

Each  student  is  required  to answer  several  questions 
related to each lab session in the lab sheet and hand in 
his/her answers.
