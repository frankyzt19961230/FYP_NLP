These can measure the students’ understanding of 
the theories and the concepts of the subject. End-

to  evaluate 
students’  ability  in  applying  concepts  and  skills 
learnt in the classroom; 

type  problems  used 

Assignments  of  reading  report  type  to  assess 
students’ ability in acquiring new knowledge related 
to communication networks; 

Students  need  to  think  critically  and  creatively  in 
order  to  come  with  an  alternate  solution  for  an 
existing problem. 

Each  group  of  students  is  required  to  complete 
work-sheets,  to  indicate  their  understanding  and 
correct completion of the laboratories. 

Accuracy and the presentation of the work-sheets 
will be assessed;
