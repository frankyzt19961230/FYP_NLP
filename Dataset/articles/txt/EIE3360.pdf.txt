At a mid-stage of the programme, this subject plays the role of applying knowledge 
acquired in other subjects in an integrated manner. While the emphasis will be 
placed  on  the  technical  challenges  that  may  encompass  system  integration, 
software  development  and 
troubleshooting,  students  will  also  be  given 
opportunities to face various non-technical difficulties behind the development of 
multimedia/information systems.  

Intended Subject 
Learning Outcomes 

  

Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to: 
 
Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 
1.  Design effective and reliable software programs to achieve the objectives 

Subject Synopsis/ 
Indicative Syllabus 

  

of a project. 

2.  Critically  evaluate 

the  different  alternatives  and  strategies  when 

implementing a project. 

3.  Locate  and  resolve  problems  in  a  multimedia  system  and  the  related 

software. 

 
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness 
4.  Search, self-learn and try untaught solutions. 
5.  Effectively  use  the  limited  resource  and  exercise  discipline  and  time-

planning to meet deadlines.   

6.  Present ideas and findings effectively. 
7.  Work in a team and collaborate effectively with others. 

Syllabus / Operation:  
 
The project(s) shall be of software development in nature with defined milestones 
(or  Subtasks).  The  scope  to  be  covered  will  include  multimedia  and  network 
system design, but does not exclude the possibilities of extending into areas such 
as computer animation or image processing.  The project will not be close-ended 
in nature and will provide ample headroom for the more enthusiastic students to 
excel. Students will work in groups of two or three.  Each Subtask will be given a 
certain  period  of  time  to  complete.    Progress  will  be  measured  by  functional 
Demonstrations, and one or two written Progress Reports. Upon the completion 
of the project, each group will give a demonstration/presentation of the completed 
system and submit a Final Report.  Students are required to individually keep a 
Logbook on the work performed during the entire period.  The logbooks are to be 
evaluated and signed by the supervisor /assessor on a monthly or more frequent 
basis.  At the end of the project, the logbooks will be collected and graded. 
 
Lectures: 
 
Lectures are to be conducted at the beginning of the semester. During these 
lectures,  the  instructor  shall  give  clear  explanation  on  the  functional  and 
technical requirements, with a schedule for submitting deliverables.  Concepts 
specific  to  the  project(s),  which  are  not  yet  learnt  by  the  students,  are  to  be 
covered in these lectures. Concepts behind critical use of tools and equipment 
will also be strengthened.  Copies of supplementary/reference material will be 
distributed, or, links to on-line material will be provided for self-paced learning.   

 
Guided Laboratory Experiments: 
 
The  project  will  normally  require  the  students  to  learn  to  use  specific  tools 
and/or equipment. Laboratory demonstrations and exercises will be arranged 
in the early weeks.  Below are some examples: 
1.  Use of project-specific development tools, software and hardware. 
2.   Implementation of the basic framework of the project. 
3.  Software techniques to optimize the performance of the system. 
 
Self-Paced Work: 
 
Multiple sessions of laboratory will be scheduled to cater for self-paced work in 
the laboratory, particularly during the second half of the semester. To ensure the 
students are working in a correct direction, defined milestones are given in the 
course of their work. Students are required to demonstrate their works at each 
milestone to show their progress.

At  the  completion  of  each  subtask,  team  members  will  be  asked  to  give  a 
demonstration  to  the  assessor.    Based  on  the  presentation  and  response  to 
questions  addressed to the members, the assessor  will rate the contribution, 
achievement,  and  performance  of  each  member.  Other  assessment  items 
include  lab  reports,  logbook,  progress  report,  final  demonstration,  report  and 
presentation.

Lab reports  

 

Progress and Final 
Demonstrations 

Logbook & Reports  

To measure  the  students’  understanding  of  the 
theories and concepts as well as some practical 
issues in their subject materials 

Students need to think critically and creatively in 
order to come up with good alternate solution for 
an existing problem. 

Oral examination on the approach taken will be 
conducted  for  each  group  member  to  evaluate 
his  contribution, 
technical  knowledge  and 
communication skills. 

Each  group  of  students  is  required  to  produce 
one  or  two  progress  reports  and  a  final  report. 
Accuracy and the presentation of the reports will 
be assessed. Each group needs to explain in the 
reports  the  solutions  they  plan  to  use  or  have 
been used in the project. The reason behind of 
choosing  such  solutions  should  also  be 
exemplified.  The  students  also  need  to  explain 
how the limited resources are used in the project 
and  how  the  team  members  work  together  to 
achieve 
the  project  goal.  Logbooks  are 
assessed  to  evaluate  contributions  and  the 
quality of records on the progress.
