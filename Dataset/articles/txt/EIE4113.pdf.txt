Objectives 

 

This subject aims to provide students with an understanding of various security 
concerns  in  wireless  networks  (e.g.,  WiFi  and  mobile  cellular  networks)  and 
mobile systems and applications (e.g., Android and iOS). 

Intended Subject 
Learning Outcomes 

 

Upon completion of the subject, students will be able to: 
 
Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 
1.  Understand  the  security  threats,  concerns,  and  vulnerabilities  in  wireless 
and  mobile  systems,  and  the  corresponding  security  mechanisms  and 
authentication procedures 

2.  Understand  the strategies  for  developing  secure  mobile  applications,  and 
the use of mobile security penetration tools for evaluating the robustness of 
mobile applications 

3.  Apply  the  knowledge  to  develop  practical  applications  that  are  robust 

against mobile platform attack tools 

  
Category B: Attributes for all-roundedness 
4.  Understand the creative process when designing solutions to a problem

Teaching/Learning 
Methodology  

Mobile security penetration testing tools.  

Lectures: The subject matters will be delivered through lectures. Students will 
be engaged in the lectures through Q&A, discussions and specially designed 
classroom activities. 
 
Tutorials: During tutorials, students will work on/discuss some chosen topics in 
small group. This will help strengthen the knowledge taught in lectures. 
 
Laboratory and assignments: During laboratory exercises, students will perform 
hands-on  tasks  to  practice  what  they  have  learned.  They  will  evaluate  the 
vulnerability of systems and design solutions to problems. The assignments will 
help students to review the knowledge taught in class. 
While lectures and tutorials will help to achieve the professional outcomes, the 
open-ended questions in laboratory exercises and assignments will provide the 
chance to students to exercise their creativity in problem solving.
