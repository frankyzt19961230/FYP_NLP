This subject will provide students with the principles and practical programming 
skills  of  developing  Internet  and  Web  applications.    It  enables  students  to 
master the development skill for both client-side and server-side programming, 
especially for database applications.  Students will have opportunity to put into 
practice  the  concepts  through  programming  exercises  based  on  various 
components of client/server web programming.
