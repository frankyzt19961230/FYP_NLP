In tutorials, students apply what they have 
learnt  in  analyzing  the  cases  and  solving 
the problems given by the tutor. They will 
analyze  the  given  information,  compare 
and  contrast  different  scenarios  and 
propose solutions or alternatives. 

Students  acquire  hands-on  experience  in 
using CAD tools in VLSI design, and apply 
what  they  have  learnt  in  lectures/tutorials 
to do a mini-project on the design of a sub-
system.

Remark 

Students are required to conduct one mini-project in 
teams of 3-4 students. The emphasis is on assessing 
their  ability  to apply  knowledge  and  skills  learned  in 
designing a complex VLSI system, ability in working 
with other  people and ability  to take data and relate 
the measurement results to theory.  Expectation and 
grading criteria will be given. 

The  students  will  work  on  a  small 
individual 
assignment  to  as  demonstrate  the  development  an 
analytical skills related the design of VLSI circuits. 

Students  will  be  required  to  perform  6-7  laboratory 
sessions  and  write  an  individual  laboratory  report. 
The emphasis is on assessing their ability to use VLSI 
CAD 
to  perform  VLSI  design. 
Expectation and grading criteria will be given as in the 
case of mini-project.

There  will  be  an  end-of-semester  examination  to 
assess  students’  achievement  of  all  the  learning 
outcomes.  Expectation  and  grading  criteria  will  be 
given as in the case of mini-project.
