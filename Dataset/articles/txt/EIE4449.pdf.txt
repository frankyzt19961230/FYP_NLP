Objectives 

To provide students with the design and operating principles of modern optical 
communication  systems  and  networks.  Upon  completion  of  the  subject, 
students should be familiar with commonly used components and subsystems 
in optical communication and network systems and be able to design a simple 
optical communication link.

End-of  chapter  type  problems  used  to  evaluate 
students’  ability  in  applying  concepts  and  skills 
learnt in the classroom; 
Students  need to think  critically  and  creatively  in 
order  to  come  with  an  alternate  solution  for  an

Laboratory sessions 

 

Each group of students are required to produce a 
written report; 
Accuracy and the presentation of the report will be 
assessed.
