validate the theoretical investigations. 

Syllabus:  
 
1.  DC Circuits 
 

Introduction to electric circuits. Voltage and current as two basic variables. 
Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws. Independent and dependent sources. 
Simple circuits: voltage divider, current divider, series and parallel circuits. 
Graphs.  Trees  &  Co-trees.  Cutsets  &  loops.  Nodal  and  mesh  analyses.  
Loop  and  cutset  analyses  of  resistive  circuits.  Thévenin  and  Norton 
theorems. Power dissipation. Source loading and maximum power transfer.  

 
2.  Capacitance, Inductance and First Order Transient 
 

Constitutive  relations  of  capacitor  and  inductor.  Introduction  to  time-varying 
circuits.  Simple  RC  and  LC  circuits.  Important  concept  of  independent  state 
variables. First-order differential equation (with simple solution of exponential 
form).  First  order  transient  analysis.  Time-domain  solution  and  transient 
behaviour of first order circuits.  

 
3. 

Introduction to Transformers 
Concept of ideal transformer (assuming sinusoidal voltages and currents). Dot 
convention.  Physical  transformer  as  ideal  transformer  with  leakage  and 
magnetizing inductances. Applications in galvanic isolation and voltage/current 
level conversion.

circuits  driven  by  single  fixed  frequency  sinusoidal  sources.  Impedance  and 
admittance. Analysis approach 1: phasor diagrams for simple circuits. Analysis 
approach 2: systematic complex number analysis, i.e., same treatment as DC 
circuits but with complex numbers representing phase and magnitude of AC 
voltages and currents. Real and reactive powers. Power factor.  
 
 
 

 

 

 

5.  Operational Amplifiers

infinite input resistance). Op-amp circuits: inverting amplifier, non-inverting 
amplifier,  summer,  difference  amplifier, 
integrator  and  differentiator. 
Applications:  instrumentation  amplifier;  current-to-voltage  and  voltage-to-
current converters.

1, 2, 4 

2, 3, 4 

Practice classes, 
where  problems are 
discussed and are 
given to students for 
them to solve 

Laboratory sessions, 
where students will 
perform experimental 
verifications. They will 
have to record results 
and write a report on 
one of the experiments. 

Assignments 

1, 2, 3, 4 

Remarks 

In lectures, students are 
introduced to the 
knowledge of the subject, 
and comprehension is 
strengthened with 
interactive Q&A. 

In practice classes, students 
apply what they have learnt 
in  solving 
the  problems 
given by the tutor.  

Students acquire hands-on 
experience in using 
electronic equipment and 
apply what they have learnt 
in lectures/tutorials to 
experimentally validate the 
theoretical investigations.  

Through working 
assignments, students will 
develop a firm 
understanding and 
comprehension of the 
knowledge taught.
