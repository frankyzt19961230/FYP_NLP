Teaching/Learning 
Methodology  

 

Lectures: The subject matters will be delivered through lectures. Students will 
be engaged in the lectures through Q&A, discussions and specially designed 
classroom activities. 
 
Tutorials: During tutorials, students will work on/discuss some chosen topics in 
small group. This will help strengthen the knowledge taught in lectures. 
 
Laboratory and assignments: During laboratory exercises, students will perform 
hands-on  tasks  to  practice  what  they  have  learned.  They  will  evaluate 
performance  of  systems  and  design  solutions  to  problems.  The  assignments 
will help students to review the knowledge taught in class. 

While lectures and tutorials will help to achieve the professional outcomes, the 
open-ended questions in laboratory exercises and assignments will provide the 
chance to students to exercise their creatively in problem solving.

Student Study 
Effort Expected 
 

 
Explanation  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  assessment  methods  in 
assessing the intended learning outcomes: 

Assignment, homework and laboratory exercises will require students to apply 
what they have learnt to solve problems. There will be open-ended questions 
that allow students to exercise their creativity in making design. 

Examination  and  tests:  They  assess  students’  achievement  of  the  learning 
outcomes more rigorously.
