students  need  to  think  critically  and  to  learn 
independently  in  order  to  come  up  with  an 
alternative solution to an existing problem. 

Laboratory sessions 

Each  student  is  required  to  produce  a  written 
report; 

the accuracy and presentation of the report will 
be assessed; 

oral  examination  based  on  the  laboratory 
exercises will be conducted for each student to 
evaluate  his/her 
technical  knowledge  and 
communication skills.
