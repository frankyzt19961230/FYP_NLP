Lectures, 
supplemented with 
interactive questions 
and answers 

Tutorials, where  
problems are 
discussed and are 
given to students for 
them to solve 

Laboratory sessions, 
where students will 
perform experimental 
verifications. They will 
have to record results 
and write a report on 
one of the experiments. 

Assignments 

1, 2, 3, 4 

In lectures, students are 
introduced to the 
knowledge of the subject, 
and comprehension is 
strengthened with 
interactive Q&A. 

In  tutorials,  students  apply 
what  they  have  learnt  in 
solving the problems given 
by the tutor.  

Students acquire hands-on 
experience in using 
electronic equipment and 
apply what they have 
learnt in lectures/tutorials 
to experimentally validate 
the theoretical 
investigations.  

Through working 
assignments, students will 
develop a firm 
understanding and 
comprehension of the 
knowledge taught.

Assignments are given to students to assess their 
competence 
and 
comprehension.  The  criteria  (i.e.  what  to  be 
demonstrated)  and  level  (i.e.  the  extent)  of 
achievement  will  be  graded  according  to  six 
levels: (A+ and A), Good (B+ and B), Satisfactory 
(C+ and C), Marginal (D)  and Failure (F). These 
will  be  made  known  to  the  students  before  an 
assignment 
their
