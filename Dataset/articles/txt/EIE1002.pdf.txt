Subject Synopsis/ 
Indicative Syllabus 

  

Syllabus: 
1. 
 

Introduction to electronics science 
Basic  concept  of  electricity  and  its  safety  issue  in  the  context  of  product 
development.  Appreciate  the  three  basic  characteristics  of  electronics 
components;  the  issue  of  poor  tolerance  and  its  remedies,  e.g.  use  of 
negative feedback and redundancy. Overview of the two basic components 
in electronics science: resistors and capacitors with their applications. 

 
2. 

Introduction to human sensory organs 
Basic  relation  between  human  sensory  organs  and  audiovisual  signals. 
Concept  of  sound  pressure  and 
its  associated  components  and 
technologies,  e.g.  speakers,  microphones,  modern  volume  control. 
Concept  of  image  and  colours  and  their  associated  components  and 
technologies.  
 

3.  Analog subsystems 

Basic  concept  of  amplification  and  its  associated  components,  e.g. 
transistor amplifiers. Basic DC power supplies and regulators with the use 
of negative feedback. 

 
4.  Digital subsystems 
 

Basic concept of switches and logic circuit implementation in the context of 
remote control via internet. Operation and design of CMOS logic gates. A 
simple RC charging circuit and its application in multi-vibrators and timers.  

 
Laboratory Experiments: 
1.  CMOS Astable Multi-vibrators 
2.  Voltage regulators 
 
Case Study: A selected topic in electronics
