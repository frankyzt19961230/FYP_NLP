While the emphasis will be placed  on  the  technical  challenges  that  may  encompass  system  integration software  development  and troubleshooting  students  will  also  be  given opportunities to face various non-technical difficulties behind the development of multimedia/information systems.  Intended Subject Learning Outcomes   Upon completion of the subject students will be able to:  Category A: Professional/academic knowledge and skills 1.  Design effective and reliable software programs to achieve the objectives Subject Synopsis/ Indicative Syllabus   of a project. 2.  Critically  evaluate the  different  alternatives  and  strategies  when implementing a project. 3.  Locate  and  resolve  problems  in  a  multimedia  system  and  the  related software.

Effectively  use  the  limited  resource  and  exercise  discipline  and  time-planning to meet deadlines.   6.  Present ideas and findings effectively. 7.  Work in a team and collaborate effectively with others. Syllabus / Operation:   The project(s) shall be of software development in nature with defined milestones (or  Subtasks).  The  scope  to  be  covered  will  include  multimedia  and  network system design but does not exclude the possibilities of extending into areas such as computer animation or image processing.  The project will not be close-ended in nature and will provide ample headroom for the more enthusiastic students to excel. Students will work in groups of two or three.  Each Subtask will be given a certain  period  of  time  to  complete.    Progress  will  be  measured  by  functional Demonstrations and one or two written Progress Reports. Upon the completion of the project each group will give a demonstration/presentation of the completed system and submit a Final Report.  Students are required to individually keep a Logbook on the work performed during the entire period.  The logbooks are to be evaluated and signed by the supervisor /assessor on a monthly or more frequent basis.  At the end of the project the logbooks will be collected and graded.  Lectures:  Lectures are to be conducted at the beginning of the semester. During these lectures  the  instructor  shall  give  clear  explanation  on  the  functional  and technical requirements with a schedule for submitting deliverables.  Concepts specific  to  the  project(s)  which  are  not  yet  learnt  by  the  students  are  to  be covered in these lectures. Concepts behind critical use of tools and equipment will also be strengthened.  Copies of supplementary/reference material will be distributed or links to on-line material will be provided for self-paced learning.    Guided Laboratory Experiments:  The  project  will  normally  require  the  students  to  learn  to  use  specific  tools and/or equipment. Laboratory demonstrations and exercises will be arranged in the early weeks.  Below are some examples: 1.  Use of project-specific development tools software and hardware. 2.   Implementation of the basic framework of the project. 3.  Software techniques to optimize the performance of the system.  Self-Paced Work:  Multiple sessions of laboratory will be scheduled to cater for self-paced work in the laboratory particularly during the second half of the semester. To ensure the students are working in a correct direction defined milestones are given in the course of their work. Students are required to demonstrate their works at each milestone to show their progress.
